          </h2>
          <p className="text-white font-thin text-sm italic lg:text-xl text-left">
            JYOTI - A Ray of Hope is indeed a wonderful initiative that provides
            quality education to economically-challenged students from nearby
            villages, slums, and tea gardens. It is truly inspiring to see
            college students selflessly dedicate their time and effort to help
            these underprivileged children. <br />
            <br />
            The school runs entirely on the support of college alumni, which
            further demonstrates the spirit of giving and social responsibility.
            <br />
            <br />I hope that JYOTI - A Ray of Hope continues to flourish and
            make a positive impact on the lives of many deserving children.
